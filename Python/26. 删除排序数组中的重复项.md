# [26. 删除排序数组中的重复项](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

## 1. 值得思考

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        j = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                j += 1
                nums[j] = nums[i]
        return j+1
```
